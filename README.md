# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System

A simple yet powerful machine learning-based crop recommendation system that suggests the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and environmental conditions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

## 📂 Dataset

We use the [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) from Kaggle. It contains key parameters like:
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorous (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall

## 🧪 Installation

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-recommendation
cd crop-recommendation
```

## Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage:

**1. Load the dataset and explore basic statistics.**

**2. Visualize correlations and distributions of key features.**

**3. Train classification models using Scikit-learn.**

**4. Evaluate model accuracy using classification_report.**

**5. Predict the best crop based on input values.**

## To run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook crop-recommendation.ipynb
```

## 🔍 Sample Output
The model outputs the most suitable crop, such as:
```bash
Recommended Crop: rice
```

## 📄 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in agriculture by recommending the most suitable crop based on environmental and soil parameters. By leveraging real-world data and effective classification algorithms, this solution can help farmers make data-driven decisions, optimize crop yield, and promote sustainable farming practices. Future enhancements may include real-time weather integration and deployment as a web or mobile app for broader accessibility.
